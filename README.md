## Features

- Extract text from images using OCR technology.
- Developed using OpenCV for image processing and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.
- Utilizes Tesseract through the `pytesseract` library for accurate text recognition.

##  Motivation
The OCR-Image-Atef project was born out of my curiosity and motivation to delve into Optical Character Recognition technology, where i developped my programming skills and got the change to know more about OCR.
