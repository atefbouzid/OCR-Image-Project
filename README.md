## Features

- Extract text from images using OCR technology.
- Developed using OpenCV for image processing and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.
- Utilizes Tesseract through the `pytesseract` library for accurate text recognition.

## Motivation

The OCR-Image-Atef project emerged from my curiosity and the drive to explore Optical Character Recognition technology. It provided an avenue to enhance my programming skills and gain valuable insights into the realm of OCR.
